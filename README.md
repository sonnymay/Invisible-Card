# Invisible-Card

Welcome to the Invisible Card project! This is a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates the power of CSS animations. When you hover over the card, it disappears and reveals a secret message.

How it works

The Invisible Card is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The card itself is a simple div element with a background color and some text. When the user hovers over the card, a CSS animation is triggered that gradually reduces the opacity of the card to 0, making it disappear. At the same time, the ::after pseudo-element of the card is revealed, displaying the secret message.
